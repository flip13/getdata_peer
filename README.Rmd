I started by getting the data from the train and test set into similar layouts. For the measured and figured variables, I then kept only the ones which contained either mean or std in the name to keep the average and standard deviation variables.  Finally the two data sets were combined.

Next, I changed the labels for the activities listed in the data from their code numbers to the descriptive version listed in activity_labels.txt.

Finally, I found the average for each mean and standard deviation variable for each activity of each of the thirty test subjects.  The data for this was output to variable_means.txt.  It can be loaded using read.table.
